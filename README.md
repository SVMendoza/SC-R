# SC-R
 A methodological pipeline for the supervised classification of remote sensing image or drone for the creation of land use and cover maps.

*Input:*  training data (signatures) in vector format (polygons, lines, points) and drone images. When a drone image is included for training, it is necessary to include file polygons with their previous classification. Satellite or drone images. additional information (e.g., elevation model) can be included. *Process:* displays all the steps and decisions made by the pipeline. The red diamonds are decisions made when loading the files. *Output:* returns confusion matrices with associated performance metrics for each classification model and the ensemble and ranked maps.![image](https://github.com/SVMendoza/SC-R/assets/18596855/066e60a7-4f39-4959-a79d-ed76b21990b6)
